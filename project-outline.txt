Project Specification: Codepen Analytics Notifier

Objective: To empower users with knowledge of changes to their Codepen projects, and drive data-informed enhancements to their creations.

Scope: This project will focus on developing a system that:

Extracts Data: Automatically retrieves pen data from a user's Codepen account.

Tracks Changes: Monitors and analyzes changes in the pen data, such as views, comments, and likes, and stores this information in a database.

Communicates Updates: Sends email notifications to users outlining the changes detected.

By doing so, we aim to provide users with insights into their Codepen project's performance and user engagement, promoting informed decision-making and potential improvements.
